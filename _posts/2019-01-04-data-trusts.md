excerpt: |
  Technical trust and legal trust are both insufficient by themselves
  to ensure protection of valuable data. Instead we need a vehicle that

  to be enforcable. In this post we discuss this concept of a data trust,
  explore what benefits they could bring and how they could be achieved.
