Recently, the Government Digital Service (GDS) announced that it will be closing two of its data services: GOV.UK Registers and the GOV.UK Performance Platform.

GOV.UK Registers launched in 2016 and has since offered access to 51 government registers. These are important, structured datasets of government information made accessible to view and use across various government services.

The datasets shared include the [country](https://registers.app/register/11:70) and [territory](https://registers.app/register/11:207) registers, the registers of further education colleges, various statistical geography registers, local authorities registers and many more.

On the 15th March, the [GOV.UK Registers service](https://www.registers.service.gov.uk/) and API will no longer be available.

## What's the good news?

For those who relied on this reference data, the loss of the GDS Registers service will be sad news. However, we have some good news! If you want to continue using these datasets and/or haven't yet had the chance to look at them, do not despair! All 51 of the UK government registers will be available on [Registers.app](https://registers.app), which is a free and open platform for linked reference data.

On Registers.app, the UK government registers are stored as [a collection of registers](https://registers.app/collection/11:3964) that you can easily browse through online or download and view independently using [our reference data tools](https://github.com/register-dynamics/orc). They will also continue to be available in Register Serialisation Format (RSF).

The platform is completely free to use, is available to all, and stores a wide range of other important and interesting datasets too; such as [registers from the European Commission](https://registers.app/collection/11:3666) and the [International Air Transport Association (IATA)](https://registers.app/register/11:79854).

## So what is Registers.app all about?

[Registers.app](https://registers.app) is a relatively new platform with a growing team and an exciting roadmap for its development. Our aim is to build it out to support sharing data effectively across teams, organisations and much more so that it becomes a tool that we hope many can utilise and benefit from. At the most basic level, it is a tool for creating, managing, storing and sharing reference data easily and that focuses on optimising and maintaining high data quality throughout.

GDS Registers is closing and it is sad to see the service go but there's still a home for government reference datasets and a wealth of others too. We will house them here in Registers.app and we are proud to be able to share them openly with you!

Registers.app is the creation of [Register Dynamics](https://www.register-dynamics.co.uk) and has been created as a way to make data more accessible, accurate and easy to use for everyone. We believe in the potential for reference data and will continue to work hard at making them available and more accessible to everyone.

If you would like to know more about Registers.app, where to find the government reference data on Registers.app, or if you have a register or reference dataset you'd like to manage using Registers.app, do [get in touch](mailto:hello@register-dynamics.co.uk)! We would love to hear from you and are here to help.
